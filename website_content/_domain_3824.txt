Mission Statement
Seven Key Principles

Content:
Part C early intervention builds upon and provides support and resources to assist family members and caregivers to enhance children's learning and development through everyday learning opportunities. Infants and toddlers learn best through everyday experiences and interactions with familiar people in familiar contexts.  All families with the necessary support and resources can enhance their children's learning and development. The primary role of a service provider in early intervention is to work with and support family members and caregivers in children's lives. The early intervention process, from initial contact through transition, must be dynamic and individualized to reflect the child's and family member's preferences, learning styles, and cultural beliefs. Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP) outcomes must be functional and based on children's and families' needs and family identified priorities. The family's priorities, needs, and interests are addressed most appropriately by a primary provider who represents and receives team and community support. Interventions with young children and family members must be based on explicit principles, validated practices, best available research, and relevant laws and regulations.
