Katy ISD is fully committed to supporting students at each educational level. Regular attendance is the first step to ensuring children are afforded all the opportunities leading to graduation. The Truancy Department is charged with identifying and addressing barriers that may be preventing students and their families from attending school daily and connecting them with the appropriate resources available in the Katy community. TEC SEC 25.085 Compulsory Attendance Law (a)  A child who is required to attend school under this section shall attend school each school day for the entire period the program of instruction is provided.
