In an effort to support at risk students, avert potential dropouts, recover previous dropouts, and help address the personal and academic needs of students, the Dropout Prevention, Intervention and Recovery Specialist oversees all KISD high school campuses and their feeder schools to assist in coordinating overall District efforts toward the common goal of increasing graduates and reducing dropouts. Under the Office of School Leadership & Support, the Specialist along with the Dropout Prevention and Recovery Facilitators serve as additional staff for student/parent support. Â Our commitment is to work closely with students, parents/guardians, and campus staff in order to assess individual needs and coordinate appropriate services available within the District and throughout the community. Katy ISD's Dropout Prevention, Intervention, and Recovery Coordination Program has been designated as one of TEA's Best Practices in Texas and has also been awarded Clemson University's National Dropout Prevention Certification of top in the Nation for both model example and training.
