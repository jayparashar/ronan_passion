Katy ISD's Community Education program provides the public with learning opportunities ranging from self-improvement, to enrichment, to recreation, and academic courses. All classes are held virtually and are offered for non-credit. Financial support for the program comes from the class fees, which must be received before students attend the virtual classes. Classes are for adults 18 and older.
