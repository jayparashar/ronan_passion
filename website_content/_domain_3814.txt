Physical education enhances the physical, mental, emotional and social development of all students.  A healthy, physically active student is more likely to be academically motivated, alert and successful.  The program will enable students to develop individual knowledge and life skills and attitudes to become healthy, physically active and productive members of society. The purpose of the Katy ISD physical education program is to provide all students with the knowledge, skills and desire to live a healthy and physically active life.   H.C.
