​If you're new, or if you've been here  awhile, there's a good chance you moved to Katy because of the school district.  Aside from having exceptional administrators and teachers, we're confident that  what makes our  district great is our volunteers.  We have a lot of them – from every walk of life, from every corner of the world – who bring their talents, time and hearts into our classrooms.  Education is a serious business – and we haven't gotten where we are by going it alone.  So we encourage you to click and browse  our menu of opportunities and read about the great things happening by Katy ISD volunteers.  Whether you are a parent, business company or community member, Partners in Education connects everyone to a singular common goal:  Making A Difference For Kids.   Karen Lewis, Executive DirectorPhone: (281) 396-2303 Katy ISD Education Foundation
