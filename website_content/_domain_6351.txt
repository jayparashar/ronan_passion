Due to dangerous storm conditions and ultimately the loss of power and internet service, the District was forced to close its administrative offices on Monday, July 8, 2024, and operate remotely. The loss and/or intermittent availability of these resources and the inability of employees, including the undersigned Public Information Officer, to access all necessary systems, information, and records made it impossible to effectively and appropriately respond to public information requests during the temporary remote operations. After restoration of power and additional assessment the District determined it could reopen its administrative offices on Thursday, July 11, 2024. For these reasons, Katy Independent School District respectfully submits this Catastrophe Notice in accordance with the Texas Government Code for the calendar days of Monday, July 8, 2024, Tuesday, July 9, 2024, and Wednesday, July 10, 2024. This notice amends and supersedes any previous catastrophe notice filed by the District related to Hurricane Beryl.
