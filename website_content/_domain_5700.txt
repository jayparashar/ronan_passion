Katy ISD annually reviews its attendance boundaries to ensure the district is adequately addressing fast growth, as well as student and staff capacity on campuses. Balancing enrollment across campuses is essential to ensuring that our students have access to safe and engaging learning environments.   Parents and guardians who could potentially be impacted by the attendance boundary modifications (ABMs) for elementary schools #47 and #48 will be emailed feedback surveys during June. The surveys will be open until October 11, 2024. The preliminary results of the surveys will be presented to the Katy ISD Board of Trustees in September and then again in a follow-up presentation in October. It is anticipated that the ABMs for elementary schools #47 and #48 will be finalized in October.  What is an Attendance Boundary Modification (ABM)?Attendance Boundary Modifications (ABMs) help the district manage growth in Katy ISD.
