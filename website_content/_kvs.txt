The Katy ISD Virtual School's primary objective is to expand the learning opportunities for our students by offering choice and flexibility for challenging online courses developed by Katy ISD. Online learning is an essential part of today's learning culture that can provide our students with the opportunity to acquire the required credit from anywhere and at any time. Online learning offers the unique experience of self-directed learning that will instill advanced learning skills as well as the Katy ISD Instructional Cornerstones in our students and better prepare them for life and college. In today's world, this model of learning is increasingly in high demand and is a cost-effective way to deliver instruction. It is a worthwhile investment in the future of our students and, eventually, can be self-sustained financially.
