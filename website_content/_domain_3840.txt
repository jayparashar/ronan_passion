Katy ISD determines eligibility for bus service based on data obtained from the Edulog system.  The Edulog system allows for the incorporation of GIS (Geographic Information System) and parcel data. This system establishes the most accurate measurement for eligibility purposes. Transportation is available to elementary students residing in greater than a ½ mile radius and secondary students residing greater than a 1 mile radius from the patron’s property line to the nearest school property line.
